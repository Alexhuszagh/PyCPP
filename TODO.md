**Short-Term**

- Need to use system versions of libraries if desired.
    - xz
    - blosc
    - libxml2
    - leveldb
    - re2

- Finish the wrapper around the key-value store.
- Write a separate API around an SQLite store.

- In libxlsxwriter, need to fix FindMINIZIP to remove Zlib-specific code (there's a lot).
